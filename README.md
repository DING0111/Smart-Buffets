## Architecture
The deployment of live weight sensors are connected to our deep learning model (LSTM) that generates time-series predictions on when and what dish to cook. This data is then fetched by the front-end cross platform Application (written in React Native) that provides chefs with live updates and alerts to create a seamless kitchen experience

## Potential
During the journey, we linked up with [Amici Events and Catering] (httos://amici.com.sg), a food catering company based in Singapaore and Malaysia. Here's what the company CEO Willie says about SmartBuffets: "This [data] will help us predict better" in the food catering business and will enable cost savings for the company.
